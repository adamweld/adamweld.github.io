Education
======
* Ms.E in Electrical Computer Engineering, Cornell University, 2019 (expected)

Work experience
======
* Winter 2016 - Present: HoverBot.io - Ultralight Racing Quadcopters
  * Engineered performance quadcopter with innovative three-dimensional carbon fiber geometry.
  * Achieved best in class flight characteristics and lightest weight for a brushless motor multirotor
with fully guarded propellers. (30 grams all-up-weight)
  * Coordinated manufacturing logistics, marketing, customer support and continued research and
development plans.


* Summer 2017: Amazon Prime Air - Drone Delivery
  * Took ownership of flight critical sensor subsystem and researched dozens of white papers.
  * Worked with team members and leadership to identify areas needing improved performance.
  * Created test plans, physical rig and fixturing, and scripting to document the precision and
accuracy of numerous possible replacement sensors and characterize their behavior.
  * Designed a densely populated six-layer printed circuit board in Altium from schematic to layout
using integrated ECAD/MCAD techniques, and performed board bring-up and testing.
  * Engineered and manufactured a CNC machined weather-sealed enclosure for subsystem.


* Summer 2016: Vantage Robotics - Snap Camera Drone
  * Fabricated debugging, manufacturing, and assembly jigs for production with CM.
  * Designed and tested interconnect circuit board with SMD components.
  * Created three-axis ball bearing test stand with .01 degree repeatability to calibrate camera
firmware and digital image stabilization algorithm.
  * Prototyped WiFi repeater handset and implemented video pass through functionality.


* Summer 2015: Project Voxa - Desktop Electron Microscopy
  * Designed electromechanical positioning subsystem for an electron microscope, from
conceptualization to the fabrication of a working production prototype.
  * Gained experience in vacuum systems and cleaning procedures and materials selection.
  * Modeled and simulated precision flexure assembly for EDM machining out of Titanium.
  * Designed, built, and tested custom nanoscale piezoelectric linear actuators and prototyped
precision four-axis linear motion system.


* Summer 2014: University of Washington - Robotics and State Estimation Lab
  * Assisted in the creation of a mobile Robotic Assistant for the Visually Impaired
  * Performed component selection, wrote software, and handled subsystem CAD design work,
sensor placement, and connecting structure architecture.
  * Accomplished fabrication and assembly of much of the robotâ€™s hardware.
  * Researched and helped implement (in ROS) visual object recognition, semantic world
knowledge system and natural language processing programs.
  * Incorporated real time video, RGBD cameras, and laser scanning technologies into feedback
and controls structure.
