### Electronics
I've enjoyed working with electronics from a young age, and as a child had an insatiable desire to take apart old and broken devices in the hope of figuring out how they worked. By the time I was twelve I had trained all of my neighbors to let me take a look at their broken electronics before giving up on them, and knew of many of the treasures hidden inside inconspicuous beige enclosures - neodymium magnets and brushless motors from a frozen hard drive, laser diodes from a DVD player, high voltage generators inside a disposable camera flash.

What captivated me then, and continues to hold my attention now, is the process of turning an idea for a device into a finished product. I've learned the hard way that design for manufacture is a philosophy that must be maintained from the very start of project, not an optimization that can be slapped on at the end. Complex, highly integrated electrical and electromechanical projects are my bread and butter.

### Robotics
I got my introduction to robotics with a BASIC stamp microcontroller, a few scrounged servos and photodiodes, and a whole lot of help from the internet, back when I was ten. Ever since then, I've been enchanted by robotics projects large and small.
