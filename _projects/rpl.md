## Demo content
The first thing I did when I set foot on Cornell campus was to search for resources in 3D printing and manufacturing. When I found the RPL, located in a small dusty lab in the side of Rhodes, I was initially told there was no way to use the printers - they were for research and project team use only. No personal prints allowed. So, I did what any enterprising new transfer in dire need of 3D printing capabilities would do - I asked for a job.

It was the perfect opportunity - make a bit of cash helping print other students' parts, and gain after hours access to the machines for my own projects. I quickly familiarized myself with the lab's offerings, which included a number of commercial and hobby grade FDM printers, a high resolution resin printer, and a laser cutter.

During my free time during shifts I drafted plans to increase lab efficiency and throughput. At night I'd sit and watch the laser cut hundreds of delrin parts for my drone startup. I took initiative in improving the space's organization, wrote a new submission form with a simpler workflow, and improved the part tracking system. 

When the lab's student manager graduated halfway through my second year at school, I took on the role and doubled down on my efforts to improve the space. Taking on the new role coincided with the RPL moving into a new lab space in the newly renovated Upson hall, and the first few weeks were absolute chaos. It was my first time in a managerial role, and I had a lot to learn.
