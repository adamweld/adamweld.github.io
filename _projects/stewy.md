## Stewart Platform
This three degree-of-freedom stewart platform, named "Stewy", was a final project built for a microcontrollers class. I took care of component selection, mechanical design, and the algorithm that controlled the stepper motors.

The platform was set up to mirror the attitude of a goat-shaped controller. The controller doubled as a mascot for our team, which we had previously dubbed the [microgoats](https://microgoats.life).
