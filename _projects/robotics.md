## Robotics
I got my introduction to robotics with a BASIC stamp microcontroller, a few scrounged servos and photodiodes, and a whole lot of help from the internet, back when I was ten. Ever since then, I've been enchanted by robotics projects large and small. Here are a few of my favorites

### Hoverbot


### Cornell CUAir

### Quadcopters
I was introduced to FPV Quads (drones, in common parlance) by my friend Luca back in 2014. I quickly dived deep into the hobby, and in the time since have built many dozens of custom drone designs. I don't have space to describe them all in any detail, but here is an album of the ones that I have pictures of!
