## Mechatronics
What's cooler that the collision of all of my favorite fields: electrical and mechanical design, sensors and actuators, and real time controls? 

Just about nothing, in my opinion.

### Stewart Platform
This three degree-of-freedom stewart platform, named "Stewy", was a final project built for a microcontrollers class. I took care of component selection, mechanical design, and the algorithm that controlled the stepper motors.

The platform was set up to mirror the attitude of a goat-shaped controller. The controller doubled as a mascot for our team, which we had previously dubbed the [microgoats](https://microgoats.life).

### Conference Telepresence Robot
This project for a Human Robot Interaction class is designed to give people on the sharp end of a telepresence video call, a bit more presence in the room. The end effector holds a phone, and the arm has five degrees of freedom to follow a converesation around the room and display emotion. 

I designed about half of the arm's 3D printed parts, and for the purposes of testing our hypothesis built a small scale 'voodoo doll' style controller with a miniature of the arm and a joystick for the end effector. I wrote simple firmware for an arm microcontroller to drive the stepper and servo motors in the arm, and smooth inputs for reduced jerk in motion.

### Piezoelectric EM Microscope stage
One of my first hardware design engineering projects, but one that I am still very proud of.
