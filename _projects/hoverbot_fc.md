## Hoverbot Flight Controller Board
I designed this multirotor flight controller PCB as a tightly integrated project for a next generation Hoverbot quadcopter. One of my most difficult boards thus far, I wanted to include some brand new sensors and design features while staying within tight size and weight constraints. It was thrilling to have full creative power over the entire electrical and mechanical design of this product!

* 30 x 30mm four-layer PCB
* STM32F4 microcontroller @ 120MHz
* On-Screen-Display 
* 4x 1-3S Brushless ESCs
* STM VL53L1X LIDAR Altimiter
* Bosche 6-Axis IMU
* CC2500 2.4GHz Digital Transceiver
* 5.0V Buck/Boost and 3.3V Buck regulators
