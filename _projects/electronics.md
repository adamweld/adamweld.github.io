## Electronics

I've enjoyed working with electronics from a young age, and as a child had an insatiable desire to take apart old and broken devices in the hope of figuring out how they worked. By the time I was twelve I had trained all of my neighbors to let me take a look at their broken electronics before giving up on them, and knew of many of the treasures hidden inside inconspicuous beige enclosures - neodymium magnets and brushless motors from a frozen hard drive, laser diodes from a DVD player, high voltage generators inside a disposable camera flash.

What captivated me then, and continues to hold my attention now, is the process of turning an idea for a device into a finished product. I've learned the hard way that design for manufacture is a philosophy that must be maintained from the very start of project, not an optimization that can be slapped on at the end. Complex, highly integrated electrical and electromechanical projects are my bread and butter.

Below, you can see a few of my recent printed circuit board designs.

### Power Regulation Daughterboard

This power regulation board was designed for my project team CUAir at school. It takes as input two LiPo batteries (a 2S autopilot and servo pack and a 6S general paylods pack), and a 28V ground supply. It outputs a number of different voltage rails to power all payloads in our unmanned aerial system.

My mentor on the team challenged me to try to use only two copper layers for the design, and I was unable to refuse.

* Two Layer PCB
* XX x XX mm
* four-week design time

### LiPo Charger Daughterboard
This design was handed to me to fix after it's initial designer left the team.

### Hoverbot Flight Controller Board
I designed this 

### Secret Bezos Board
I'm only able to share this work using the principle of safety by obscurity.
