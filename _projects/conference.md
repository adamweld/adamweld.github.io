## Conference Telepresence Robot
This project for a Human Robot Interaction class is designed to give people on the sharp end of a telepresence video call, a bit more presence in the room. The end effector holds a phone, and the arm has five degrees of freedom to follow a converesation around the room and display emotion. 

I designed about half of the arm's 3D printed parts, and built a small scale 'voodoo doll' style controller with a miniature of the arm and a joystick for the end effector for the purposes of testing our hypothesis. I wrote firmware for an arm microcontroller to drive the stepper and servo motors in the arm, and smooth inputs for reduced jerk in motion.
