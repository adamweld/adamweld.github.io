## Additive Manufacturing
When I first discovered 3D printing back in 2009, I thought them interchangeable with magic. The ability to instantiate any design in physical form, in a few hours - what an incredible capability!

Of course, the truth is much more nuanced. In the decade I've spent working with 3D printers and designing for additive manufacture, I've learned that these machine sare truly amazing for some use cases, and highly flawed in other cases. In the three years I spent managing the Cornell Rapid Prototyping Lab (RPL), I saw thousands of parts printed that never should have made it past the drawing table. Fundamentally, I've found that knowing intimately the capabilities and gotchas of the machine you are using, and designing your part with those limitiations in the front of your mind, is crucial for achieving good performance with 3D printed parts.

Below you will find a few of my projects and thoughts on Additive Manufacturing.
